# Text Replacement Tool in Python

This Python script enables users to replace occurrences of a specific word in a given text with a new word. It's a simple utility suitable for basic text manipulation tasks.

## How it works

1. The script initializes with a predefined text.
2. It prompts the user to input the word they want to replace (`exist_word`) and the new word (`new_word`).
3. It checks if `exist_word` exists in the text.
4. If found, it replaces all occurrences of `exist_word` with `new_word`.
5. The modified text is then displayed.

## Usage

To use this script:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script (`replaceWord.py`).
3. Follow the prompts to replace words in the provided text.

## Example

Given the text:
The sun was setting over the ocean as I walked along the beach. The warm sand felt soft between my toes as I searched for interesting shells. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore was soothing, and I felt my worries slowly draining away. As I strolled, I noticed a few seagulls flying overhead, and I couldn't help but smile at their playful cries.


If you want to replace `waves` with `breeze`, you would input:

Which Word Do you want to replace: waves
Give me the New Word: breeze


The output will be:
The sun was setting over the ocean as I walked along the beach. The warm sand felt soft between my toes as I searched for interesting shells. The sound of the breeze crashing against the shore was soothing, and I felt my worries slowly draining away. As I strolled, I noticed a few seagulls flying overhead, and I couldn't help but smile at their playful cries.
